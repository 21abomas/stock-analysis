## VBA Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to refactor a VBA script that analyzes the stock market data for 2017 and 2018. The original script was designed to loop through the entire data set multiple times, which resulted in slow execution time. The objective was to optimize the code by iterating through the data set only once and collect all the necessary information to improve the performance.

# Execution Time Comparison
The following screenshots show the execution time for the original script and the refactored script for both 2017 and 2018.

## Summary

Refactoring code can provide several advantages, including improving performnce, making the code more readable and maintainable, and reducing bugs. However, there can also be some disadvantages, such as increased develpment time and the risk of introducing new bugs.

In the case of this VBA script, the advantages of refactoring were significant. By optimizing the code, we were able to achieve a significant improvement in performance, reducing the execution time.

However, refactoring also came with some disadvantges. It took additional development time to identify areas for optimization and implement changes. Additionally, there was a risk of introducing new bugs into the code, although thorough testing can help mitigate this risk.

Overall, the advantges of refactoring this VBA script far outweighed the disadvantges, and the resulting improvements in performance and maintainability make it a worthwhile endeavor.
